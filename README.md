# M5Stack-Proto
M5Stack enhanced prototype board and case.

The prototyping board allows through hole connections to the header and therefore the base and battery can then be refitted for standalone use.

Note: The tracks used are undersized in order to pass between the header pads and therefore not recommended for production use.
